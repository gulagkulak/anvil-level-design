# Anvil Level Design Readme

## Intro

Anvil Level Design (Anvil LD) is an addon for blender that combines various tools to speed-up video game level design. It has a particular focus on material application but the overall scope is varied.

Anvil LD is particularly inspired by Trenchbroom.

Anvil LD is a hobby project. AI is used.

## Installation

Download the zip from github: on the main github screen click code -> Download zip.

Edit -> Preferences -> v arrow -> Install From Disk -> Select the zip file

Minimum Blender version is 5.1. Until Anvil is more mature, backwards compatibility is not prioritised.

## Quick Start

Anvil adds new workspaces 'Hotspot Mapping' and 'Level Design.' You must be in those workspaces to use Anvil features. If you lose them, go to addon preferences -> Anvil -> Create X Workspace.

You can remap addon hotkeys in the addon preferences; they are collected there for your convenience. Common keys to remap or turn off are camera and texture application tools.

Move around using the right mouse button.
Tab switches between object and edit mode.
Press G to move selection.
Press E to extrude selection.
Alt click to select loops.
Press B to experiment with adding cubes. Object and edit mode.
Press L to select connected faces; useful when added multiple cubes in edit mode and want to select them separately.
Press C to experiment with cutting cubes. Edit mode only.
Apply your first texture by highlighting a face and choosing an image in the file browser.
Select a textured face and Alt Left Click another face to copy the texture over. 
Select a textured face and press T to enter Texture Mode; move the mouse to different edges to snap the texture to that edge.
Extrude some faces to see the auto UVing do its magic.

See the Anvil, Anvil (Settings) and Anvil (Export) panels to discover other features.

*Do not resize in object mode using the scale operator unless you know what you're doing. You should prefer resizing your level by moving and extruding faces.*

*Choosing whether to create disconnected geometry in edit mode or object mode is a matter of preference and organisation.*

More details below!

## Features

### Material and UV Management

Select a face and Alt Left Mouse button to apply the same material to another face.

With a face selected, choose an image file in the file browser to apply it.

With a face selected, use Alt Right Mouse to pick a texture from another face (including from different objects).

Anvil LD manages materials to prevent duplicates. Use the Cleanup Unused Materials buttons if unused materials become bothersome.

The currently selected image is previewed in the side panel; here the texture transparency channel can be linked to the shader, and roughness can be adjusted. 

Default material settings for new textures could be adjusted on the Anvil (Settings) panel.

Default default material settings for new .blend files could be adjusted in the Anvil addon preferences.

Various options for material settings are presented for convenience (e.g. enabling transparency and vertex colours). They target .glb export and may or may not be suitable for your use case.

Fix Alpha Bleed is a utility tool that edits the source image to set transparent pixels to a specified colour, to fix some cases of visible edges on transparent cutout materials (the blender 'premultiply alpha' setting can fix this without editing the source image, but .GLB exports don't support this flag).

Alt Left Mouse tries to seamlessly tile textures across different faces and around corners.

Shift Alt Left Mouse applies a texture with the same dimensions stretched to the target face (for example, useful for step sides). Shift Alt Right Mouse picks a texture to be stretched.

Ctrl-Alt Left mouse applies a UV without changing the material. Ctrl-Alt Right mouse picks a UV without changing the material

Manual UV adjustments are possible via the Anvil LD panel:
* Scale, Rotation, and Offset can be manually set. At 1 scale, the pixels per meter setting controls how large materials appear in the level
* UV shapes that do not match the 3d face are not strongly support but:
* When UV lock is turned on, adjusting a face will cause the applied material to warp along with the face
* When UV lock is turned off, adjust a face will not affect the material in world space e.g. when extending a wall, the applied wall material will remain natural looking (bricks won't stretch)
* Shortcuts are provided to reset scale, rotation, and offset (Face-Aligned project); centre and fit materials to faces

Select a face and press T to enter Face Snapping UV Mode. In this mode by default the bottom of the texture will snap to the edge *closest to the mouse cusor*. Use WASD to select different texture edges. Use Q and E to set FIT modes.

Select multiple quad faces (1 island only) to enter Grid Snapping UV Mode. The controls are the same as above, but the snapping will apply across the quad grid.

Press Shift-T to enter UV Transform Mode. You are able to move and resize the UV on your geometry via handles on a live preview. When multiple faces are select you may choose which face is the 'origin' by hovering over it with your cursor while pressing Shift-T.

Dragging a resize handle through its opposite side mirrors the texture — the resulting Scale U or Scale V in the panel goes negative. You can also type a negative Scale U/V directly in the panel to flip a face.

### Hotspot Mapping

Hotspot mapping automatically assigns UV coordinates by matching face shapes to predefined regions on a texture atlas. It allows you to quickly add details to models.

Hotspot UVs are never mirrored — assigning a hotspot always produces a non-flipped mapping, regardless of the face's previous UV state. Mirrored textures (negative Scale U/V) are only supported on regular, non-hotspot faces.

See 'examples/hotspot_tutorial.blend' for a visual explainer of the hotspotting process.

#### Setting Up Hotspot Maps

Hotspot maps are defined in the Image Editor:

1. Open your texture atlas in Hotspot Mapping workspace
2. Click the Hotspot Edit tool in the left sidebar
2. In the Anvil panel (N key), click "Assign Hotspottable" to mark the texture as a hotspot source
3. Add lines in the image to split the texture into hotspots.
4. Hold ctrl to add a non grid line
5. Hotspots can be resized by dragging lines

Hotspot data is stored in the .blend file. An external json can optionally be defined so hotspot info can be shared across projects.

As in 3d views using this addon, '[' and ']' control pixel snapping.

#### Orientation Types

Each hotspot has an orientation type that controls which faces it can be applied to. Click the orientation button next to a hotspot, or on the orientation icon on the hotspot itself, to cycle through types:

* **Any** - Can be applied to any face. Rotation is randomised
* **Upwards** - Only applies to wall faces (vertical surfaces). The texture's top edge will point upward in world space. Useful for textures with a clear "up" direction like bricks or siding
* **Floor** - Only applies to floor faces (surfaces facing up). Rotation is randomised
* **Ceiling** - Only applies to ceiling faces (surfaces facing down). Rotation is randomised

#### Applying Hotspots

In the 3D viewport, the Anvil panel provides hotspot controls.

You can manually trigger the hotspot selection logic to selected faces (or all faces if none are selected or the object is in edit mode) using the Randomise Hotspots button.

You can toggle auto applying random hotspots when making geometry edits; this only adjusts hotspots on moved geometry.

If you like a hotspot you can enabled the 'fixed' property on selected faces to stop Randomise Hotspots changing it.

The 'Choose Hotspot' button will allow you to manually select a 'fixed' hotspot.

##### Allow Combined Faces & Seam Mode

The hotspotting algorithm is able to treat connected faces as one face for the purpose of hotspot application. This works on series of faces that curve or bend. The algorithm attempts to find groups of faces that when taken together can be roughly transformed into a rectangle. The algorithm splits 'islands' based on normals and user added seams.

This functionality can be turned off by unchecking allow combined faces.

Whether or not this functionality is enabled, the hotspotting algorithm adds seams automatically to help UV unwrapping. The seam mode controls what happens to these seams.
* Maintain User Seams clears the automatically added seams so from your perspective seams are unchanged
* Display All Seams (unsurprisingly) displays all seams; it is primarily useful to see what the algorithm is treating as an island if your hotspot textures don't make it clear
* Clear All Seams is there just in case

For now the hotspotting algorithm does not attempt to split non-rectangular islands. As an example: if the algorithm finds an L shaped island of 3 faces, it won't split it into 2 rectangular islands; it will treat each face separately.

##### Size Weight & Texture Thoughts

Once the hotspotting algorithm has chosen islands, it must choose the closest matching hotspot for each island. 

By default the hotspot with the closest matching aspect ratio the island will be chosen, to preserve the texture / pixel aspect ratio.

Depending on the texture atlas used, the closest matching aspect ratio hotspot (or one of the multiple closest matching aspect ratio hotspots) may be small, leading to a blurry texture.

Drag the Size Weight to introduce weighting towards hotspots that match the same texel density.

It is important to have a wide variety of aspect ratios and sizes in your texture atlas to ensure that hotspotting will look good on any given object you create.

### Geometry Tools

#### Selection

##### Backface Culling

Anvil overrides some selection behaviours to ignore culled backfaces when not in x-ray mode.

This works for box select and lasso select when single clicking, shift clicking, and alt clicking on items. 

Due to blender api limitations it does not work for box selecting or lasso-ing items, and it does not work with circle select or the tweak tool.

Vertex painting does not work through backface culling, so when you enter vertex paint mode, face orientation will be enabled if it is not otherwise. This lets you see what you cannot paint through.

This addon sets the front face orientation colour to transparent in the active theme.

##### Paint Select

Ctrl Left mouse paint selects, which is similar to circle select (hold and drag to add crossed items to the selection) but respects backface culling.

##### Select Connected

Anvil also has its own select connected. Press L while hovering your cursor over a 3d element so select all connected elements.

Press Ctrl-L while hovering your cursor over a 3d element to select all connect elements with matching normals. Press Ctrl-L to add to the selection all faces at normals that are closest to facing the seed face normal. Continued Ctrl-Ls will select further faces. Ctrl-Shift-L will go back a step.

Shift-L will add a connected island to the selection.

#### Weld

Press W to *Context Aware Weld.* This action does various things in specific circumstances. The next weld is flagged in the Anvil panel; specifics are described in the appropriate sections in this README.

#### Cube Cut

Press C in edit mode to enter cube cut mode.

Click on a face in the 3d perspective view to start drawing the cube; move your mouse and click again to define the rectangular face that will be cut. Move your mouse a third time to define the cube; click a third time to make the cut.

Cube cut only affects selected faces (if no faces are selected, it will affect all faces).

Draw a rectangle in an orthogonal view to do an infinite depth cut (I advise taking advantage of cube cut only affecting selected faces.)

Cube cut avoids N-gons and T-Junctions.

Hold shift on first click to start with a line (allows rotated cube cuts).

Hold ctrl to lock the axis, allowing you to move the cursor off a given face while keeping the same draw plane.

After a cube cut, WELD can do 3 things:
1) When the cube cut has depth but intersects with one plane, WELD creates a corridor with a closed end to the depth of the cube cut
2) When the cube cut spans across multiple faces, WELD joins the holes into a corridor with open ends
3) When the cube cut spans across multiple faces with a 'blank' side, WELD creates a plane folded onto the cut geometry

#### Box Builder

Press B in edit or object mode to enter box builder mode.

Click on a face in the 3d view to start drawing the cube; move your mouse and click again to define the rectangular face that will be cut. Move your mouse a third time to define the cube; click a third time to make the box.

A 0 depth box will become a plane.

Select a vertex to align the box creation when not building on an existing face

Hold shift on first click to start with a line (allows rotated built boxes).

Hold ctrl to lock the axis, allowing you to move the cursor off a given face while keeping the same draw plane.

After a cube cut, WELD will invert the cube.

#### Knife Cut

Press K in edit mode to enter knife cut mode. Click on mesh faces to place cut points snapped to the Anvil grid. Press Enter, Space, or Right Click to confirm the cut. Press Escape to cancel.

Hold Shift to place points off-grid on the surface. Hold Alt to snap to the closest vertex (including previously placed cut points).

### Camera and Viewport Tools

Hotkeys are intended to be blender default.

Holding down Right Mouse Button in a 3d view will enable game engine style WASD flying. This uses blender's in built walk navigation. Anvil manually modifies hotkeys due to blender limitations. 

Middle mouse button orbits the camera in perspective grid views.

Middle mouse button in orthographic grid views will pan the camera. 

Num keys set orthographic view angles even when camera rotation is locked.

A useful hotkey to remember is numpad . to focus objects.

Use '[' and ']' to double and half the grid size.

The grid size is relative to the blender scene length unit (i.e. if you choose unit inches, 1 Anvil grid unit will equal 1 inch).

Ctrl-G toggles between incremental and grid snap. Generally incremental snap is the most useful, but some operators (especially slides) behave more consistently with grid snapping.

Alt-G toggles the face overlay grid.

### Exporting

Right now there are no bespoke export behaviours. This means you can work with Blender and your game engine as you normally would.

.blend files are typically not directly imported by game engines (though it visually seems like that)

Godot and Unity can both automatically translate the .blend to a hidden intermediary format (.gltf and .fbx respectively).

.fbx image file paths are defined on export.

.gltf image file paths are defined by the file paths blender uses. Be aware of the 'set paths to relative' and 'set paths to absolute' blender options. Be aware that for Godot if your image files are in the same folder as your .blend file and paths are set to absolute, you may not notice until a collaborator opens the project and has missing textures on the imported level (because they do not have the same folder structure as you).

To help you avoid unexpected behaviour, **Anvil sets paths to relative on save.**

.glb files include the images in the exported file. Good for mods but not recommended if you're making a game with multiple levels that will share the same materials.

Image files getting copied into your project unexpectedly is a sign that you are referencing image files that are outside of the project folder or the exported level contains image files; your game engine is making sure the images are available in your project and their import settings can be edited.

In short, the simplest workflow is to keep images used for level design in your project folder:
* For Unity - work with a .blend file in your project
* For Godot - ensure the reference to blender is configured in settings, then work with a .blend file in your project; ensure image paths are relative in the .blend file
* For Unreal - export a .fbx to your project (untested)

If you need non-PBR custom materials use in-engine approaches
* For Unity - Set the import settings to search the project folder for materials with the appropriate name
* For Godot - Write an import script to create/find and set external materials for each model material
* For Unreal - tbd (I'm not an unreal dev)

#### New Gltf export settings

There is an Anvil panel on the default gltf export screen. It adds:
* Scale
* Apply Modifiers
* Separate Loose Meshes (into different objects, valuable for culling)

The quick export button exports the scene with previously used settings, skipping popups.

## Keybindings and Feature Toggling

All keybinds can be adjusted in the normal Blender keymap settings.

Keybinds added or modified by this addon are exposed in the addon preferences so they can be found easily.

By disabling keybinds you can disable features (like the free camera).

## Additional Settings

When the addon is loaded it sets the following:
* Enable Grid snapping
* Set unit system to None; set grid subdivisions to 1 (grid size is constant regardless of zoom level)
* Lock camera rotation for orthographic grid views (hotkeys still work)

For a more convenient experience I recommend you consider adjusting the following:
* Change Focal Length (view panel) (it helps with interiors)
* Auto Merge Vertices (options in edit mode)

## Limitations / Known Issues / Notes on Blender / Hacks / etc

* Changing grid size does not work during an operation
* Grid snapping does not work when zoomed out far in orthographic mode (blender bug: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/137957).
* Due to file browser API restrictions, you must hold alt-click to pick an image if it is already selected.
* Box selection, lasso selection, circle selection, and individual selection in tweak mode all do not respect backface culling. This limitation is primarily due to the ways we can override existing operators.
* Blender has built in UV correct: correct face attributes. It defaults to off. It doesn't work well when extruding faces orthoganally.
* Blender has built in UV correct: correct UV (vertex and edge slide). It defaults to on. It mostly works well but has a few annoyances (sometimes just doesn't work; base UV is affected by initial move when using the G hotkey). It also (guess) causes face data to move in memory, causing crashes when Anvil UV is working. UV correct is not exposed via Python, so we disable it by directly accessing blender memory. Brittle!
* The way Anvil figures out which faces to auto UV is edge case city. I recently (time of writing) made some large changes. Leaving undocumented until it is more stable.
* You are unable to set addon keymaps for modal internal hotkeys i.e. 'exit walk view.' For this reason, Anvil manually adjusts user keymaps when required. I aim to do this in a way that does not destroy your existing keymaps.
* Anvil manages materials for you based on image file names. If you rename an image file or rename a material you may run into issues.
* The way we run initial addon setup is edge case city. See comments in code.
* It's not feasible to have paint mode respect backface culling due to the complexity of brush operators. It means you must be 'inside' a room to paint faces you can see, or hide backfaces. Which is additionally annoying (above needing to select them in the first place given we ignore them due to backface culling) because you cannot select / hide faces in painting modes. I'm currently experimenting with forcing face orientation to be on in vertex paint mode. Anvil sets the front face orientation colour to transparent. Or maybe adding a "hide all hidden-anyway-because-they-are-not-facing-you" faces button
* We mostly do texture application and propogation via the scale / offset / rotation abstraction. Affine based texture application is more general; currently only alt-left click will use affine texture application, and only in some cases (this is really a note to myself to not forget about it!)
* Blender's spin operator seems to trigger the undo/redo stack every frame...? We hack around that.
* Spin leaves zero-area wall faces along its axis; we detect and delete them by checking `bpy.context.active_operator == MESH_OT_spin` in the depsgraph handler. This is the only place we use active_operator, and the check fires only on spin. Because active_operator is sticky, the reference can leak across tests and trick the handler into running the cleanup mid-extrude (welding the new duplicate verts back into the old ones). Production doesn't appear to hit this because normal keymap dispatch updates active_operator to the new op before any geometry depsgraph fires — but the timing is fragile, so worth bearing in mind.

### GLTF / Godot Material Limitations

Right now Anvil doesn't aim to support any particular engine. That being said, the shader settings Anvil controls are based on what exports to .gltf and imports into Godot. I've found a few issues!

* Specular is not imported at all: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/83320. I think there is a pr: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89344. Interestingly it seems Blender, GLTF, and Godot all have different understandings precisely of how to define specular. 
* If roughness in blender is changed to 1 (from another value), godot will not reimport it. Changing it to 0.999 works fine
* Emission is scaled incorrectly (a tiny emission in Blender has the power of the sun in Godot)

## Undocumented

Ok, the fact it's here means it's documented. This section is for stuff that is experimental / may be removed.

* UV Shortcuts can be keybound but currently don't have defaults
* THere is a hidden select 0 area UVs operator that can be keybound
* Multi-UV functionality is undocumented because I consider it experimental. Lets see how it works out
